The Butns plugin enables you to add more destinations to each hyperlink on your blog, allowing your users to choose exactly where to go for more info.

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy to use Butns from Wordpress. Butns is a
service that enables you to add more destinations to each hyperlink on
your website, allowing your users to choose exactly where to go for
more information. This new plugin introduces a small menu-icon to the
wordpress editor (tinymce), so that you can now add butns links with
the press of a single button. It has never been so easy!

As an example, say that you have written the word 'sushi' in your
blog. If you then select the text and click on the butns icon, you can
associate a number of destinations with this word. Exactly as a normal
hyperlink, except that you don't have to limit yourself to one
destination. Whenever one of your blog-readers mouse-overs the sushi
word, he/she will now be presented with a small bubble displaying the
possible destinations. This makes it possible to for instance let your
'sushi' link point to both a wikipedia description explaining what it
is, a youtube video of how to make it, and a google search to find
even more information. For more details, see http://www.butns.com.
